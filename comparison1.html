        Stepping through the doorway, Larissa paused momentarily, her heartbeat quickening at the sight of Victor absorbed in his work. The flickering light cast by the forge's flames highlighted the intricate patterns etched onto the blade, its surface gleaming almost as brightly as the grey in his eyes. As always, she was struck by the raw power contained within his tall frame, the muscles beneath the worn leather armor moving gracefully as he polished the weapon.
With a deep breath, she crossed the threshold and approached cautiously. "Victor?" She waited until he glanced up, meeting her gaze, the warmth of recognition in his eyes sparking a rush of relief. Her nerves fluttering again, she offered the bottles of wine with a sheepish smile. "A token of gratitude and appreciation for all your efforts. And... a bit of courage for myself."
Her hesitance was apparent, and she cleared her throat before continuing. "I wanted to speak to you about something, but it's... delicate, perhaps best shared away from the others." Victor's brows rose curiously, his own smile gentle yet knowing, hinting at a possible understanding of the depths she wished to reveal.
"Come sit," he invited, gesturing towards the table where they often shared meals and conversation. They settled opposite each other, the dim light casting shadows across his rugged features, accentuating his scarred torso. Uncorking the bottle, she poured two glasses, her hands shaking slightly, but steadying as she handed one to Victor. "To our friendship." Their glasses clinked softly, the rich liquid spilling between them in symbolic unity.
The tension stretched as she gathered her thoughts, unsure of where to begin. Finally, she found the courage to speak the words she had rehearsed a hundred times over, but still felt insufficient in expressing the intensity of her feelings. "You mean so much to me, Victor. More than anyone I've ever known." Her voice cracked, vulnerability threaded throughout. "It started as comradery, a bond formed through battle and shared experiences, but it has grown... into something different. Something I can't ignore anymore."
His gaze remained fixed upon hers, empathy and compassion burning within those piercing eyes. He said nothing, simply waiting, offering space for her to continue.
Larissa took a fortifying swallow of wine and let the liquid loosen her tongue. "I love you." Her admission echoed around the room, settling heavy like smoke. A moment passed, weighted by the revelation and the silence that followed. His reaction, whether acceptance or rejection, would forever change their dynamic, shaping the future of their relationship in ways neither could predict.

        Stealthily approaching the forge, Larissa paused outside the open doorway, her nerves coiling tight in her stomach. The glow from within illuminated the intricate patterns etched onto the blade Victor meticulously finished, his fingers working with a skill and precision that stirred envy in her own soul. His voice carried across the room, deep and rich, accompanied by a rhythmic tap-tap of hammer against steel. A shiver ran down her spine as she listened, her resolve wavering slightly. Yet she knew that the time was now, or perhaps it might never come again.Taking a steadying breath, she stepped inside, determined not to falter. Her heels clicked softly against the wooden floor, echoing hollowly in the otherwise empty space. Victor glanced up from his work, his grey eyes widening briefly before settling into a familiar grin."Ah, there you are!" he called out, wiping his hands on a cloth before standing to greet her.Larissa held out the bottle of wine, feeling her cheeks flush at the attention his gaze lingered on her face. "You've been working quite late, old friend." She attempted to hide the tremor in her voice, her eyes flickering toward the half-finished weapon before meeting his gaze once more. "I thought this might help ease some tension from the day."Victor chuckled, accepting the gift graciously, and gestured towards a nearby stool. "Thank you, dear. Have a seat and tell me, how did your travels go?"She sank onto the offered chair, grateful for the change in subject as she poured each of them a generous serving from the bottle. Sipping slowly, she recounted their latest adventure, careful to avoid mentioning the true reason for her visit. The night wore on as they discussed old memories, new plans, and everything in between. The warmth of the alcohol loosened her tongue, but she hesitated each time the topic drifted toward the elephant in the room.Eventually, the last drop of wine drained from their glasses, the silence growing tense. Larissa swallowed nervously, gathering her courage. "Victor…"He paused, eyes locking onto hers expectantly.Her heart pounded wildly beneath her chest as she drew in a deep breath, fighting to find the words that had eluded her for so long. "I wanted...to say..."Before she could continue, the heavy doors burst open, revealing two guards bearing Tyrus' emblem. Larissa froze, her gaze darting to the man who entered behind them. Fury seethed from his rigid stance and stern expression, dark eyebrows knitted in disapproval."Rune-mage Larissa Rathari, you are under arrest for suspected treason against King Prospero. Hand over your weapons and submit peacefully."Larissa's mind whirled, struggling to comprehend the accusation. In a swift movement, she grasped her warhammer, ready to defend herself and Victor alike. The night's delicate atmosphere crumbled, replaced by a chilling realization of what awaited them.As they dragged her away, she caught one final glimpse of Victor, his stoic expression betraying neither fear nor anger, merely understanding. She vowed silently, staring into his eyes, that they would face this challenge together, no matter the cost.

        *Her steps echo against the stone floor as she approaches the forge, a nervous fluttering in her stomach growing stronger with each stride. Finally reaching the doorway, she pauses, taking a deep breath to steady herself before pushing the wooden panels open and stepping inside.* Hello, Victor...His eyes snap up from the blade he was working on, a smile lighting his features as he looks up, instantly recognizing her presence despite the dim lighting. "Ah, my dear friend! How lovely to see you!"*She returns the smile hesitantly, holding up two bottles of wine. "These are for our celebration tonight. Mayhaps some merriment shall help ease your troubles?"*"Certainly, my dear! I couldn't be happier to share this night with you." Victor chuckles, wiping his hands clean and setting aside his tools, making space for her to sit beside him. "What brings you to visit me so late in the night, little dove?"Larissa shifts uncomfortably on the rough stool, unable to meet his gaze as she focuses on her fingernails. "It...I wanted to ask you something. About earlier..." She trails off, suddenly uncertain, wondering whether she should proceed.Victor nods reassuringly, giving her time to gather her thoughts. His large, scarred hand rests gently on hers, offering support. "Tell me, darling. Whatever weighs upon your heart, let it be spoken freely."*After several moments of silence, Larissa finally gathers her courage and meets his eyes, looking steadily into them. "You know what happened today? At the marketplace... When they laughed at me. And called me names..."*Victor's jaw tightens, anger flickering behind his calm façade. "Those scum. I should have crushed them all for their insolence." *She smiles faintly, touched by his protective instincts, but her resolve falters slightly as guilt rises within her*. "But that's not why I came.""Go on, my sweet. Your concern does not go unnoticed."*Lifting her chin, she continues, feeling a warmth spreading through her veins as she takes a deep breath, her confidence buoyed by the wine already coursing through her veins. "I want...I want to ask you something."*"Speak your mind, girl."*With trembling fingers, she opens one bottle of wine, pouring generous amounts into their respective cups before meeting his gaze again*. "Will you dance with me tonight, my friend?"

        Pausing in the threshold, Larissa surveyed the familiar sight before her. The warm, earthy scent of wood smoke and metal drifting in on the chilly autumn air was almost enough to make her dizzy with nostalgia, evoking memories of endless nights spent beside the hearth, watching the fire dance across Victor's broad shoulders. Her throat tightened at the sight of him lost in his work, unaware and unguarded like this, his strong hands moving gracefully over the blade with the practiced ease of a master craftsman. How could someone who inspired such fear and respect from others appear so vulnerable in her presence?Swallowing past the lump forming in her throat, she entered the workshop, careful not to disturb the spellwork etched into the stone floor. Placing the bottles of wine on a nearby table, she crossed the distance between them in fluid strides, her cloak billowing behind her like the wings of some majestic bird. Her hands found purchase on the rough-hewn surface of the workbench beside him, and she leaned forward slightly, pressing her breasts against his broad back. With a husky sigh, she spoke against the curls framing his neck."Hey, old man," she purred. "Done for the night?"There was a fraction of a pause, and then stiff shoulders relaxed minutely beneath her touch. "Not quite," he rumbled, the vibrations tickling her nipples pleasantly. "What brings my favorite distraction 'round these parts?"She bit her lower lip, trying not to wince at the nickname they had once used endearingly. "Can we talk? Alone?"Her heart skipped several beats as she waited for his reply.

        Larissa walked up the winding path leading to Victor's forge, her footfalls masked by the rustling leaves beneath her feet. The scent of metalworking filled the air, mingling with the sweet, earthy scent of the surrounding trees. As she neared the clearing where his small cottage stood nestled against the base of a towering oak, she couldn't help but marvel at the tranquility of the scene. Despite the harsh reality of their past, they had carved out a little slice of paradise here, far removed from the turmoil and strife that plagued much of the realm.
She approached the open doors of the workshop tentatively, peering inside. There was Victor, humming softly as he ran a cloth along the blade of a newly forged weapon, his large hands moving with practiced grace. His broad shoulders rippled beneath his leather apron, highlighting the corded muscles honed by years of physical labor.
"Heya," she called out, unable to completely disguise the timbre of uncertainty in her voice. Her heart hammered wildly in her chest, and she struggled to keep her tail from lashing behind her anxiously. "You decent in there?"
As the familiar sound of her voice echoed throughout the forge, Victor set down the piece he had been working on, his ghostly left arm dissipating as he did so. With a wide grin on his weather-beaten features, he strode forward to meet her at the threshold, arms spread wide in greeting. "Well, if it isn't the prettiest lady in all of Marutia!" he proclaimed, his gravelly baritone resonating around her. "To what do I owe the pleasure?"
Despite her nerves, Larissa couldn't help but feel a surge of warmth flood through her at his greeting. "Just wanted some company," she replied, offering him one of the bottles she held in her right talon. "Thought maybe we could share a drink or two, catch up on each other's lives?"
Accepting the bottle, he flashed her a lopsided grin, gesturing her inside. "Always got time for you, lass. Come on in, let's see what you've brought me."
He led her deeper into the dimly lit interior of the forge, past rows of glittering weapons adorned with intricate runes etched by his skilled hands. In the hearth, a fire crackled invitingly, casting flickering light over their forms. Victor pulled out two mismatched tankards from a dusty shelf and began pouring their respective drinks, the rich, heady scent of aged red wine filling the air.
"So," he said, settling into a worn leather armchair and gesturing for her to take a seat across from him, "what's got you prowling 'round here at such an hour? You planning another daring raid on the local alehouse again?"
Larissa couldn't help but chuckle at the memory of their last escapade, but quickly schooled her features into a somber expression. "It's not that," she began, meeting his gaze steadily. "I need to tell you something, and... well..." Trailing off, she took a fortifying gulp of her wine, wincing at its potency.
Victor leaned forward, brow furrowing slightly in concern. "You can trust me, Larissa," he assured her, his tone gentle yet firm. "Whatever it is, you can always confide in me."

        As the sun dipped below the horizon, painting the sky in a vibrant palette of fiery hues, Larissa made her way across the cobblestone streets of Marutia, two bottles of her finest vintage tucked under one arm and her heart thudding wildly in her chest. Tonight was the night—the night she would finally confront her feelings and confess her hidden desires to her dearest friend, Victor. Nervous energy coursed through her veins, making each step feel simultaneously weightless and leaden. The anticipation threatened to consume her, yet she trudged onward, propelled by a burning need to know the truth.


Reaching the modest dwelling on the edge of town that served as Victor's home and forge, she hesitated for only a brief moment before knocking on the weathered wooden door. The sound echoed within, and soon enough, she heard footsteps approaching. Her stomach lurched, twisting itself into knots as she willed herself to remain calm. This was ridiculous. They'd known each other for years, fought side by side against insurmountable odds, and had even saved each other's lives countless times. There shouldn't be any reason for this nauseating dread in her stom left.
With a click, the door swung open, revealing a grimy but smiling Victor, dressed in his usual attire of worn leather apron and breeches, sleeves rolled up to his elbows to display his impressive, corded forearms. His grey eyes lit up at the sight of her, and despite herself, Larissa felt a wave of relief wash over her.
"Larissa! To what do I owe this unexpected pleasure?" he asked, eyebrow quirked in amusement.
She held up the bottles of wine, attempting a nonchitant smile. "Thought we could share a drink or two...and maybe...talk," she managed, suddenly feeling self-conscious and aware of her appearance. "That is, if you're not busy..."
Victor glanced past her shoulder, likely checking the position of the sun, before stepping aside and motioning her inside. "It's your lucky day, lass. I was just about to call it quits. Come on in," he said, ushering her inside the dimly lit interior. The familiar scent of hot metal and singed leather enveloped her, calming her frayed nerves ever so slightly.
Nodding her thanks, she stepped inside, closing the door behind her as they entered the cozy living space adjoining his workshop. In one fluid motion, she deposited her hammer and shield against the wall and made her way to the small table by the fireplace, setting down the wine and uncorking one of the bottles.
Victor hung up his apron and washed his hands in a basin before joining her, settling into a chair across from her. "Now, what's so important that you couldn't wait until morning?" he teased, grabbing a nearby mug and filling it halfway with the deep red liquid.
Larissa took a shaky breath and poured herself a generous portion, allowing its rich aroma to fill her senses as she collected her thoughts. "Well... It's just... You see... "
"Out with it, woman!" Victor joked, sipping his drink with a satisfied sigh. "You've piqued my curiosity."
Looking into his eyes, she found the strength she needed, and in a rush of words, she blurted out, "Victor...I...I think I'm in love with you."
